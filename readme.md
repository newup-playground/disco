# NewUp Playground: Disco

This playground explores a PHP implementation of [kayladnls/disco](https://github.com/kayladnls/disco), while making use of various utilities that NewUp provides. Check out the [original repository](https://github.com/kayladnls/disco). It is pretty cool.

## Using The Playground

First make sure that NewUp is installed and configured. After that, issue the following command to disco:

~~~
newup a newup-playground/disco
~~~

> This playground requires that newup is running at least version [0.0.4 pre-release](https://github.com/newup/core/releases/tag/0.0.4) of [core](https://github.com/newup/core).

After a moment, disco will begin prompting you to learn:

~~~
php newup.php a newup-playground/disco
